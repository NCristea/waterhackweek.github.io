[The hackweek model](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00028) has emerged within the data
science community as a powerful tool
for fostering exchange of ideas in research and computation by providing training
in modern data analysis workflows. In contrast to conventional academic conferences
or workshops, hackweeks are intensive and interactive, facilitated by three core
components: tutorials on state-of-the-art methodology, peer-learning, and on-site
project work in a collaborative environment. This setup is particularly powerful for
sciences that require not only domain-specific knowledge, but also effective computational
workflows to foster the rapid exchange of ideas and aid discovery.  

The workshop encourages collaboration between participants, rather than competition, and provides extensive opportunities each day for participants to work with each other to build their skills with water data. We welcome applications from researchers from all domains of water-related study, at all stages in their careers, as well as from government, non-profit and private industry. We particularly encourage requests to attend from junior participants and people who are new to data-driven science.

Because Waterhackweek is a new and evolving format for data science training, in 2019 we recorded a cyberseminar series to introduce participants to the range of topics. Although space at our Seattle event is limited, all seminars and tutorials are available to the public (link to [2019 Waterhackweek Cyberseminar series - CUAHSI](https://www.cuahsi.org/education/cyberseminars/waterhackweek-cyberseminar-series/)); project data and tutorial resources are publicly available on our Github organization, and HydroShare group. For an example of topics and schedule, please see the [Waterhackweek 2019. Schedule](https://waterhackweek.github.io/schedule.html).


*Waterhackweek* is pleased to join the ranks of 
other succesful hackweeks hosted at the University of Washington and eScience Institute, including 
[Geohack](https://geohackweek.github.io/), [Oceanhack](https://oceanhackweek.github.io/), [Astrohack](http://astrohackweek.org/2018/) and [Neurohackweeks](https://neurohackademy.org/).
