[The hackweek model](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00028) has emerged within the data
science community as a powerful tool
for fostering exchange of ideas in research and computation by providing training
in modern data analysis workflows. In contrast to conventional academic conferences
or workshops, hackweeks are intensive and interactive, facilitated by three core
components: tutorials on state-of-the-art methodology, peer-learning, and on-site
project work in a collaborative environment. This setup is particularly powerful for
sciences that require not only domain-specific knowledge, but also effective computational
workflows to foster the rapid exchange of ideas and aid discovery.  *Waterhackweek* is pleased to join the ranks of 
other succesful hackweeks hosted at the University of Washington and eScience Institute, including 
[Geohack](https://geohackweek.github.io/), [Oceanhack](https://oceanhackweek.github.io/), [Astrohack](http://astrohackweek.org/2018/)and [Neurohackweeks](https://neurohackademy.org/).
